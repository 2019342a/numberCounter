# numberCounter
A simple counter using swiftUI

## What is it?
A simple dummy iOS app that provides a simple MVC swiftUI example. The app contains a single view, two
buttons and a display. The user can click the buttons to increment/decrement the number that is
currently displayed on the screen. The app is a slight modification from an app in the book
[A SwiftUI Kickstart](http://media.pragprog.com/newsletters/2020-10-14.html) which I suggest
reading and buying.

## Why?
This is more of a reference app that I can come back as it is a very simple application to understand,
read and test but still provides solid swiftUI features and tests.

## Usage
Clone the repo and open the `Counter` folder using xcode. You can from there, run the app, run the tests
or run the preview on the `ContentView.swift`.
